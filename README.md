# ViciousSquirrel

First, fork the branch from BurnningGlory/ViciousSquirrel into your own repo.

You should now have your own version of ViciousSquirrel within in your profile, for example: DaveH2/ViciousSquirrel 
                                                                                                forked from BurningGlory/ViciousSquirrel.

Next, clone your forked repo (the one you have in your profile) into your local machine, for example: https://github.com/DaveDH2/ViciousSquirrel.git

Then add a new remote version: something like RM or another name besides origin. Origin in this case is the main repo: BurningGlory/VicisiouSquirrel.

RM or what ever you decide to call it will be the profile repo.
